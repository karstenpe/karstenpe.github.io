# Organization and Information Management - 204-003-IO-01

## Goals (Qualifikationsziele)

In this course participants gain an overview of historic roots, developments, and challenges of organizing and managing information in general, and the ongoing rise of personal and networked computing over the last few decades in particular.
  
Participants know how to map, analyze, and conceptualize personal and collective landscapes of devices (phones, tablets, laptops, etc.), tools and services,  
for creating, sharing and managing digital artefacts and information items in mediated work settings. They are aware of how the ongoing proliferation of networked devices, tools and services, not only impacts their private life, but also fundamentally challenges the operation of organisations at large.

To better understand this emerging challenge, participants also gain an overview of classical and modern organisational theories and concepts. They also comprehend the importance and analytical value of such theories and concepts. 

Participants can compare, analyze and reflect upon contemporary organizational structures in the light of the ongoing development of information technology and the changing nature of increasingly mediated work practices.
